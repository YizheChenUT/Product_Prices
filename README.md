# Product Price Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository provides a structured approach for analyzing product price data using SQL and Quarto. The project includes data cleaning, simulation, and analysis of price trends, correlations, and biases based on observational data.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data` contains the simulated and analysis data.
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interactions  and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the SQL scripts used to simulate, test and analyse data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT. Some parts of paper were written with the help of ChatGPT and the entire chat history is available in `other/llm_usage/usage.txt`.
